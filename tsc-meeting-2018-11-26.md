# General

Openstack summit Berlin:

Multi cloud demo at Openstack summit. KPN interested in it. Some metadata from object metadata goes to multi-cloud engine. Use it for discovery etc for placement. Might use by Big-data analysis team.

Linbit – need to contact Xing on extending replication

Openstack – extended to open infrastructure. Will look into other open source projects, under openstack foundation. Does openSDS fit in there? Perhaps, but only if there is a clear gap.

Ceph days – nothing different, a project for federated ceph. Not many backers besides usual. Some ML stuff. 

CloudNative Con Shanghai:  2500 attendees.

Intro and deep dive CNCF Storage WG – different storage layers affecting attributes – mainly from terminologies perspective.
Snapshot feature in k8s – take snapshot, upload to AWS

China meetup – it was full, people from China Mobile, China Telecom Intel, Mesosphere, IBM, 4-5 talks. Demo on multi-cloud feature. 

China Mobile – want to join OpenSDS. They are big sponsor of Ceph. Have ability to do development. TSC or EUAC? Perhaps TSC.

Internet initiative of Japan (IIJ) – big provider in Japan (ISP). Interested in data management, data lifecycle. Officially joined. 

Another meetup in Dec in Japan? Container days, Opensource forum, so OpenSDS meetup is postponed till Jan.

# Swordfish in person meeting update 
(Sean)

Meeting 2 weeks ago with SNIA, went pretty well. 

Swordfish gave more details on how it is to be implemented. 

Gave OpenSDS details, both sides have better understanding.

They are interested in partnership using alliance agreement so that deliverables are clear.

Draft agreement in place, need to review.

If we do implement Swordfish support, they will promote OpenSDS nicely. We will be focus on how Swordfish works in an actual running implementation.

We need to change some things – minor – like replication schedule etc.

Overall, really good collaboration, there is work to do, but not much.

Need to figure out OpenSDS to be Swordfish API only or multiple APIs.

Need to have internal meeting on what we commit.
